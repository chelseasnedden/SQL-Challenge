# SQL-Challenge
## Background

"It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files."

## I designed these tables using an ERD to hold the data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered queries about the data. This allowed me to explore the fundamentals of:

#### :diamonds: Data Modeling
---
#### :diamonds: Data Engineering
---
#### :diamonds: Data Analysis

## How to run: Download the Queries_SQL file into a SQL database of your choosing (I used PGAdmin4) and add the CSVs provided in this GitHub.
